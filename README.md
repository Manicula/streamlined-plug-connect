This includes authenticating a user's identity and requesting Plug Agent permissions to sign requests to your canisters on behalf of the user's identity.\n\n## ü§î Installation\n\nStreamlined Plug Connect package is available in [GitHub Package Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry) and not in the [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).\n\nYou'll need:\n- A personal access token. You can create one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).\n- The token should have the scopes, **repo** and **read:packages**, to access the [GitHub Package Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).\n- Authentication via `npm login`, using your Github email for username and the personal access token as your password.\n\nOnce you have these ready, run:\n\n```
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@Streamlined\n```
\n**Note:** You only need to configure this once to install the package!\n\n## üéÅ Use\n\nYou can now import the PlugConnect package:\n\n```js\nimport PlugConnect from '@Streamlined/plug-connect';\n```\n\nUse the component:\n\n```js\n<PlugConnect\n  whitelist={['canisterid-1', 'canisterid-2']}\n  onConnectCallback={() => console.log(\"Some callback\")}\n/>\n```\n\n...\n\n**Connection & Agent Persistence Check**\n\n...\n\n## ‚ö° Development\n\nYou'll need to have `nodejs` installed.
